\titlepg{Lagrangian Cobordisms of Legendrian Pretzel Knots with Maximal Thurston-Bennequin Number}{Raphael Walker}{May}{2021}

\abstr

In the study of Legendrian knots, which are smoothly embedded circles constrained by a differential geometric condition, an actively-studied problem is to find conditions for the existence of Lagrangian cobordisms, which are Lagrangian surfaces whose slices specific Legendrian knots at either end.
Any topological knot has infinitely many distinct Legendrian representatives, which are partially distinguished by the Thurston-Bennequin number $\tb$, an integer invariant of Legendrian isotopy which is bounded above.
We demonstrate a family of knots where each has a maximal-$\tb$ representative $K$ admitting a Lagrangian cobordism from a stabilized Legendrian unknot, a property which guarantees the existence of a similar cobordism from stabilized unknots to any representatives resulting from stabilization of $K$.

\dedic

Dedicated to my 10\textsuperscript{th} and 11\textsuperscript{th} grade math teachers, George Palen and Masha Albrecht, respectively. Mr. Palen gave me challenging open-ended problems to work on when I was bored with the curriculum, and Ms. Albrecht introduced me to calculus --- how one can learn calculus without immediately falling in love with mathematics is beyond me. 

\acknowl

My wonderful advisor Caitlin Leverson for guiding me firmly but manageably into this project.\\
Everyone to whom I have tried and failed to explain what Legendrian knots are.
