In the study of Legendrian knots, which are constrained by a differential geometric condition, little is known about the existence of Lagrangian cobordisms, which are Lagrangian submanifolds stretching between two embedded Legendrian knots.
Some such cobordisms can be constructed by a sequence of basic moves; they are called constructable.
For any topological ribbon knot $T$, one can construct such a cobordism from some Legendran unknot $U$ to a Legendrian representative $K$ of $T$.
In this paper, we consider constraints on the Thurston-Bennequin numbers of $U$ and $K$ under which this is possible.
Specifically, if the maximal TB of $T$ is $t$, we are interested in whether it is always possible for $tb(U) = tb(K) = t$.
