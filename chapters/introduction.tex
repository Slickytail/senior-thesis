\chapter{Introduction}
Knots

Notes from Caitlin:
Read through introductions for papers -- chantraine paper, cornwall, Ng, WiSCon, etc.
As a thesis, probably wants more motivation. Etnyre's "Legendrian and Tranverse knots".
Smooth knots study 3/4 dimensional smooth manifolds, Legendrian knots and Lagrangian cobordisms help us study contact and symplectic manifolds. 
For an introduction, you're "selling" the result.

Write an outline!
Compile list of topics. 

Motivation: if you have a cobordism and you stabilize both, you still have a cobordism. So finding cobordisms to max-tb representatives gives you cobordisms to all representatives.
A lot is known about smooth cobordisms -- this project helps us know about the structure of Lagrangian cobordisms.
Ribbons are helpful because they already "have" smooth cobordisms: we're interested in when the existence of a smooth cobordism gives us information (or even implies) the existence of a Lagrangian cobordism.

4-ball genus? 

Comments on thesis: 
    - update the abstract:
        - say something a little bit more concrete about what Lagrangian knots (maybe give a semi-definition of knots)?
        - Lagrangian submanifolds NOT "stretching between": the knots are slices of them.
    - Consistently use bold for definition
    - Maybe use capital greek letters for Legendrian knots?
    - Mention the right-hand rule for why the positive $y$ direction points into the page.
    - Cusp slopes don't have to approach zero, but they really just have to approach the same slope.
    - Consider adding a 3D rendering of a Legendrian knot. Sabloff has a nice one?
    - State Reidemeister move equivalence as theorems for both smooth and legendrian. give pictures of smooth reidemeister. Mention that reidemeister plus planar isotopy is necessary. 
    - Define orientation of knots (maybe before you define tb?)
    - Clarify upward and downward pointing -- $t$ increasing?
    - Mention that we'll talk about the difference between our definition and Lu-Zhong method.
    - Give an example of computing Kauffman polynomial.

April 02:
    - Add a sentence of introduction to each section, or maybe even subsection
    - Elaborate on smooth cobordisms in introduction to them.
    - Everywhere tangent to *kernel* of differential form
    - In defn. of smooth cobordism: mention "with boundary".
    - clarify "bottom" and "top".
    - ${ }$ to avoid line wrapping. In general, don't line wrap equations.
    - Mention that cobordism "movies", arrow points in direction of increasing $t$.

Consider moving the section on Kauffman polynomial into the chapter on knots...
