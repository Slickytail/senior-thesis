\section{Motivation}
Similarly, for Legendrian knots it is clear that ribbon knots can be constructed from a sufficiently stabilized unknot using the Reidemeister moves, one 0-handle, and one 1-handle. 
Starting from the unknot, we add a second unknot with a zero-handle, and then use Legendrian isotopy to "pass" the tip of the first unknot through the two loops as desired, before finally using a 1-handle to join the ribbon tip to the second unknot, thus closing the knot. 
TODO: give a better "proof".

The cobordism created by these moves is necessarily a concordance: The surfaces corresponding to each unknot have genus zero before the addition of the 1-handle, which connects them in only one place.
TODO: is this explanation right?

Thus to construct such a cobordism to a ribbon knot $K$, we have to start with an unknot $U$ with $\tb U = \tb K$. Given the topological knot type of $K$, the unknot and $K$ must certainly have $\tb \leq \overline{\tb} K$.
It is an open question when this can be achieved with equality: that is, when a cobordism can be constructed from a stabilized unknot to a maximal-TB Legendrian ribbon knot. 

The main result of this project is the demonstration of a family of ribbon knots for which such a cobordism may be constructed with maximal Thurston-Bennequin number.

    Let $K = P(3, -3, n)$.
