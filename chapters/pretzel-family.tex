\section{Motivation}\label{sec:motivation}
There is no general method of finding Lagrangian cobordisms, and there are very few sufficient conditions for their existence.
A natural way of refining this question is to restrict either $K_-$ or $K_+$.
In particular, we want to know under what conditions there exists a decomposable cobordism from the unknot $U$ to some Legendrian knot $K$. This choice is not arbitrary: it is unclear whether any of the known obstructions give information about the existence of such cobordisms when $\maxtb K \leq -1$.

A good candidate for this search is the class of knots called ribbon knots, which we define here.

\begin{definition}
    A knot $K$ is said to be \textbf{ribbon} if $K$ bounds a smoothly embedded disk $d: D \to \R^3$ with only ribbon singularities.
    That is, every region of self-intersection of $d$ is an arc $A \in \R^3$ such that the preimage of $A$, $d^{-1} (A)$, consists of two arcs in $D$ of which one is within the interior of $D$ and the other has its endpoints on the boundary of $D$.
\end{definition}

This definition is more clear alongside a ribbon diagram, Figure~\ref{fig:ribbons}.

\begin{figure}[ht!]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.6\linewidth]{images/ribbons.pdf}
    \caption{Diagrams for some ribbon knots, with the arcs of self-intersection marked with dashed lines. The forms of these ribbons come from \cite{kawauchi}.}
    \label{fig:ribbons}
\end{figure}

Ribbon knots are a natural class to try to find Lagrangian cobordisms to, as topologically there always exist smooth cobordisms between the unknot and any ribbon knot (recall that the existence of  a Lagrangian cobordism from $K_-$ to $K_+$ implies the existence of a smooth cobordism between the two).
In the case of Legendrian knots, it is known that ribbon knots admit decomposable Lagrangian cobordisms from sufficiently stabilized unknots \cite{leverson-etnyre}.
For a ribbon knot with one band, we can start from a twisted Legendrian unknot, add a second unknot with a 0-handle, and then use Legendrian isotopy to "pass" the tip of the first unknot through the two loops however desired, before finally using a 1-handle to join the ribbon tip to the second unknot, thus closing the knot. 

The cobordism created by these moves is necessarily a concordance: Each 0-handle adds a separate component to the link, and the 1-handle only adds genus if between two points on the same component.
Thus to construct such a cobordism to a Legendrian ribbon knot $K$, we have to start with a Legendrian unknot $U$ with $\tb U = \tb K$. Given the topological knot type of $K$, both $U$ and $K$ must certainly have $\tb \leq \maxtb K$.
It is an open question when this can be achieved with equality: that is, when a cobordism can be constructed from a stabilized unknot to a maximal-$\tb$ Legendrian ribbon knot.

\section{Constructions of Cobordisms}\label{sec:thm-a-proof}
The main result of this project, Theorem~\ref{thm:mine}, is the demonstration of an infinite family of knots, each of which has a maximal-$\tb$ Legendrian representative admitting such a Lagrangian concordance from a Legendrian unknot.

\begin{mythm}\label{thm:mine}
    Let $P_n = P(3, -3, n)$ (the knot shown in Figure~\ref{fig:pretzel-knot}), for $n$ an integer. Then there exists a Legendrian representative $K_n$ of $P_n$, and a Legendrian unknot $U_n$ with ${\tb K_n = \tb U_n = \maxtb P_n}$, such that there is a decomposable Lagrangian concordance from $U_n$ to $K_n$.
\end{mythm}

Figure~\ref{fig:pretzel-knot} shows a diagram of a knot in this family.
For example, $P(3, -3, 0) = 3_1 \# m(3_1)$. Further known examples are $P_1 = 6_1$; $P_2 = 8_{20}$; $P_3 = 9_{46}$; $P_4 = 10_{140}$, and $P_5 = 11n_{139}$. We also note that $P_{-n} = m(P_n)$ \cite{kawauchi}.

\end{figure}

We break the proof of this theorem into the following two lemmas.
\begin{lemma}\label{lem:tb}
    \[
        \maxtb P_n = \min \{ -n-4, -1\}.
    \]
\end{lemma}

\begin{lemma}\label{lem:cobordism}
    For each $P_n$, there exists a Legendrian representative $K_n$ of $P_n$ and a stabilized Legendrian unknot $U_n$ such that 
    \[
        \tb K_n = \tb U_n = \min \{-n-4, -1\},
    \]
    and there exists a decomposable Lagrangian concordance from $U_n$ to $K_n$.
\end{lemma}

The proof of Theorem~\ref{thm:mine} follows trivially from Lemmas~\ref{lem:tb}~and~\ref{lem:cobordism}, which we prove here.

\begin{proof}[Proof of Lemma~\ref{lem:tb}]

    We first compute the degree of $a$ in the Kauffman polynomial of $P_n$; as this allows us to obtain a bound on $\maxtb P_n$ by Theorem~\ref{kauffman-bound}. We use the method from \cite{lu-zhong} for computing the Kauffman polynomial of a pretzel knot, and find that $- \deg_a Y(P_n)$ is given by $\min\{-n-4, -1\}$. We implemented this computation in Mathematica; for details see Appendix~\ref{ch:appendix}.
    
    By Theorem~\ref{thm:ng} (Ng), the Kauffman bound is sharp for the pretzel link $P(3, -3, n)$ except when $n = 0$ or $n = \pm 2$. That is, ${\maxtb P_n = \min\{-n-4, -1\}}$ for $n \neq 0$ and $n \neq \pm 2$. We will deal with these cases presently.

    In the case where $n = 0$, ${P_0 = 3_1 \# m(3_1)}$. The Thurston-Bennequin number of a connected sum is well known \cite{torisu}, \cite{honda}. In particular,
    \[
        \maxtb{K_1 \# K_2} = \maxtb K_1 + \maxtb K_2 + 1.
    \]
    Thus $\maxtb P_0 = -6 + 1 + 1 = -4$ as desired \cite{atlas}.

    In the case where $n = \pm 2$, we have $P_2 = 8_{20}$ and $P_{-2} = m(8_{20})$, and therefore ${\maxtb P_2 = -6 = -2-4}$ and ${\maxtb P_{-2} = -2 = 2-4}$ as desired \cite{atlas}.

\end{proof}


\begin{proof}[Proof of Lemma~\ref{lem:cobordism}]

    \begin{figure}[ht]
        \centering
        \includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{images/isotopy-presentable.pdf}
        \caption{Smooth isotopy from the pretzel diagram for $P(3, -3, n)$ to a twisted ribbon.}
        \label{fig:isotopy}
    \end{figure}

    Depending on the value of $n$, there are three cases.

    In each, we first construct a suitable unknot $U_n$ with the desired $\tb$, using stabilizations or RI moves to add a total of $n-1$ half-twists, and we show the form of the desired Legendrian representative $K_n$. Figure~\ref{fig:isotopy} verifies that $K_n$ is in fact smoothly isotopic to $P(3, -3, n)$.

    We then use the decomposable moves to describe a decomposable Lagrangian cobordism from $U_n$ to $K_n$. A more detailed example of this construction is seen in Figure~\ref{fig:cobordism-construction}.

\begin{itemize}

    \item[$n \geq -1$ :]

        The desired $\tb$ is $-n-4$.
        We start with an unknot stabilized $n+1$ times in order to add $n+1$ left half-twists, as seen on the left in Figure~\ref{fig:pretzel-geq}.
        We add a 0-handle, and then use the Legendrian RII and RIII moves to thread the twisted band through both loops, before connecting them with a 1-handle.


        As this cobordism is in fact a concordance, we have $\tb U_n = \tb K_n$, so it suffices to check that $\tb U_n = -n-4$. The diagram for $U_n$ has three right cusps and $n+1$ crossings, each of which is negative. Thus $\tb U_n = -(n+1) - 3 = -n-4$ as desired.

        Note that in the case $n = -1$, the band is untwisted, as in Figure~\ref{fig:cobordism-construction}.
        \begin{figure}[ht!]
            \centering
            \includegraphics[width=0.95\textwidth]{images/cobordism-movie-g0-short.pdf}
            \caption{Cobordism movie for constructing $K_n$, where $n \geq 0$.}
            \label{fig:pretzel-geq}
        \end{figure}

    \item[$n = -2$ :]

        Recall that $P_{-2} = m(8_{20})$, and its maximal $\tb$ is $-2$. In the twisted band we will have $1$ \emph{right} twist.

        The diagram for the unknot $U_{-2}$, on the left, has 3 right cusps and a single crossing with positive sign. Thus $\tb U_{-2} = 1 - 3 = -2$.

        \begin{figure}[ht!]
            \centering
            \includegraphics[width=0.95\textwidth]{images/cobordism-movie--2-short.pdf}
            \caption{Construction of $K_{-2}$.}
            \label{fig:pretzel--2}
        \end{figure}

    \item[$n \leq -3$ :]

        The desired $\tb$ is $-1$. Using the RI move we can add as many right half-twists as we like (i.e., $|n| - 1$) to our $U_n$ before we make the pinch move.

        Note that in Figure~\ref{fig:pretzel-leq} below, there are a total of $|n| - 1$ right half-twists, but one of them "stays behind" when we pass the ribbon tip through the loops.

        The diagram for $U_n$ has $|n|$ right cusps and $|n| - 1$ positive crossings, so $\tb U_n = (|n| - 1) - |n| = -1$ as desired.

        \begin{figure}[ht!]
            \centering
            \includegraphics[width=0.95\textwidth]{images/cobordism-movie-l-3-short.pdf}

            \label{fig:pretzel-leq}
        \end{figure}

\end{itemize}

\end{proof}

For a few specific $n$, Theorem~\ref{thm:mine} is sufficient to show that all Legendrian representatives of $P_n$ admit Lagrangian cobordisms from the unknot.
\begin{corollary}
    All Legendrian representatives of $P_1$, $P_3$, $P_{-3}$, and all but (possibly) one of $P_{-1}$ admit decomposable Lagrangian concordances from stabilized Legendrian unknots.
\end{corollary}
\begin{proof}

    Recall that if there exists a Lagrangian cobordism from $K_-$ to $K_+$, then there exists a Lagrangian cobordism from $S_-(K_-)$ to $S_-(K_+)$ and from $S_+(K_-)$ to $S_+(K_+)$, where $S_-$ and $S_+$ denote positive and negative stabilization respectively. Thus it suffices to check that all Legendrian representatives of $P_n$ are either $K_n$ or obtained from $K_n$ by repeated stabilization.

    For $P_{1}$ and $P_{\pm 3}$, all stabilized Legendrian representatives are known to be stabilizations of a single representative with maximal $\tb$ \cite{atlas}. This representative is necessarily $K_n$.

    In the case of $P_{-1}$, all stabilized representatives are stabilizations of \emph{either of two} maximal-$\tb$ representatives. That is, from \emph{either} maximal representative, all non-maximal representatives may be obtained by stabilization. Thus one of these representatives is $K_{-1}$, but it is unclear whether the other admits a Lagrangian concordance from the unknot.

\end{proof}
